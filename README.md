# syntax-highlighter
A tool that highlights JavaScript code, but as for right now **please do not use**. This is still a **WIP**.

## Using the main code creating function:

When using the `createCode();` function the following syntax should look like this:

```javascript
   createCode('The code you want to display.', 'What tag you want to put the code in.', 'Where to place the code.', 'Code styntax (for right now only dose JavaScript).'
```
